# There are 5 Codes :
### 1. Apriori Algorithm
Apriori is one of algorithms that has been used for Market Basket Analysis. Market basket analysis is process of discovering frequent item sets in large transactional database. In short, we want to know relationship beetween items that we have bought.
### 2. Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
Collaborative filtering is one of algorithm which has been used for recommendation systems. In this case, we will use for recommendation movie. Collaborative filtering will recommend film based on other user's ratings about that film.
### 3. Content Based Algorithm
Content Based Filtering is one of algorithm which has been used for recommendation system. Content Based Filtering will gives us recommendation based on our 'data'. For example, if we take the case is recommendation movie. This algorithm will recommends us film based on films that we have watched and doesn't care about other viewer's rating/opinion.
### 4. Hybrid Filtering Algorithm
Hybrid filtering is combination of Collaborative and Content Based Filtering Algorithm. This algorithm has 2 types :

* Collaborative + Content Based
* Content Based + Collaborative

The difference is about order of algorithm.

### 5.  A/B Testing Algorithm
A/B Testing is used to understand if a difference between two versions is statistically significant




# Dataset

There are 4 datasets:
1. Burger Star.csv is about burger restaurant transaction. This dataset is used for Apriori Algorithm
2. Recommendation_data.py is about rating film from viewer who have watched that film. This dataset is used for Collaborative, Content Based and Hybrid Filtering Algorithm
3. Dataset1.csv is about description film , it has few explanation about film (Director,Actress,Genre,Country), This dataset is used for Content Based and Hybrid Filtering Algorithm
4. ab_data.csv is about e-commerce website for testing old page and new page. This dataset is used for A/B Testing Algorithm
